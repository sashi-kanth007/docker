# docker
Spring Boot application demonstrating Docker containerization, with a README guide on  detailing the steps to build, deploy, and run your Java application using Maven and Docker.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Docker

  ## Build and Package the Project

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:
    ```sh
    mvn clean package
    ```

    This command will create a JAR file in the `target` directory of your project.

## Docker Instructions

### Create a Docker Image

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
    Ensure a `Dockerfile` with the following content is in the root directory of your project:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the JAR file into the container at /app
    COPY target/your-project-name.jar app.jar

    # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the JAR file
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
    ```

    Replace `your-project-name.jar` with the name of the JAR file generated by Maven.

2. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```sh
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    ```
     Replace `your-image-name` with the desired name for your Docker image.

### Run the Docker Container

1. **Run the Docker container**:
    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
    ```

    Replace `your-image-name` with the name of your Docker image. This command maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the Docker container.

2. **Verify the container is running**:
    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

## Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access your application.

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed and configured correctly.
- Verify that the Docker container is running by using the `docker ps` command.
- Check the application logs for any errors by using the `docker logs <container_id>` command.
